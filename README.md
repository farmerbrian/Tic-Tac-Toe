# rock-paper-scissors

This is a project I created from a project assignment at The Odin Project.

A few things that it forced me to better understand:
Event Listener's
Querying the DOM
Array's
Passing arguments into Functions
Calling outside Functions from within a Function
If Else statements
Inserting variables into a string
